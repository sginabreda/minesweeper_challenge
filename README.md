## Minesweeper Challenge
### Notes:
* The design of the API is DDD (Domain Drive Development) oriented, divided by layers in which
the main layers are application, domain and delivery.
* The API has two controllers: one for the operations related to the game (such as create one,
get games, list cells, etc) and the other for the operations related to the user (create and 
get token).
* For local tests it uses a H2 database.
* For deploys, it uses Heroku.
* In prod environment, it uses an instance of PostgreSQL.
* To operate with the games, one must use a jwt token previously generated by the API.
